                                    of their business processes or laborious and repetitive tasks but are put off by the 
                                    cost of legacy software and software engineers.</strong>
                                    &nbsp;Microns are tiny custom build smart software applications that perform only a small number of functions. 
                                    Each Micron is optimized without having to make concessions for incumbent technology. 
                                    Microns are a cost-effective means to finally ensure your organisation can profit from the digital era.
